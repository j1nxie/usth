USTH Study Notes Emporium
=========================

This is an effort to condense, simplify and extend the contents of lectures for
ICT majors at the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi. My goals are
creating a clean, comprehensive and easy to understand version of lecture notes
for everyone, with additional explanation if needed.

I found some lectures very long and sleepy, without much focus on the most
important parts of the content. Thus, this serves as a repository of knowledge
for subjects taught at USTH, but written in a way that everyone can gain
something out of.
