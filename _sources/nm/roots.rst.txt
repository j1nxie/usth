Roots of Non-linear equations
=============================

In this section, we will go through two of the methods to find the roots of a
non-linear equation: Bisection method and Newton-Raphson method.

.. _bisection:

Bisection method
----------------

The bisection method is a very simple method to find the roots of a non-linear
equation, also called the binary search method. 

Although the method is simple, it is **not very efficient**. It is also **not
very robust**. The method is based on the fact that the function must have
different signs at the endpoints of the interval. The method also requires
that the function be continuous. If the function doesn't have the above
requirements, the bisection method will not work.

**Step 1**: Choose the interval :math:`[a,b]` such that :math:`f(a)` and
:math:`f(b)` have different signs.

**Step 2**: Find the midpoint of the interval:

.. math::
  
   c = \frac{a+b}{2}

**Step 3**: If :math:`f(c) = 0` then :math:`c` is the root of the equation. If
:math:`f(c) \neq 0`, then repeat steps 2 and 3 with the new interval
:math:`[a,c]` or :math:`[c,b]` depending on the sign of :math:`f(c)`.

- If :math:`f(c) < 0`, then we assume :math:`a = c`.

- If :math:`f(c) > 0`, then we assume :math:`b = c`.

**Step 4**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired accuracy is achieved.

**Example**: Find the root of the equation :math:`f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - 3` in the
interval [1,2].

First, find the midpoint of the interval, in this case:

.. math::
    
   c = \frac{1+2}{2} = 1.5

Then, evaluate the function at the midpoint:

.. math::
    
   f(1.5) = (1.5)^3 - (1.5)^2 - 3 = -1.875

Because :math:`f(c) < 0`, we assume :math:`a = c`. Therefore, we repeat the
process with the interval [1.5, 2].

.. math::
    
   c = \frac{1.5+2}{2} = 1.75

Then, evaluate the function at the midpoint:

.. math::
    
   f(1.75) = (1.75)^3 - (1.75)^2 - 3 = -0.7031

Because :math:`f(c) < 0`, we assume :math:`a = c`. Therefore, we repeat the
process with the interval [1.75, 2].

Following the same steps, we have the table below:

After 11 iterations, we have the approximate root of the equation is
:math:`x = 1.8638`.

.. _newton:

Newton-Raphson method
---------------------

Newton-Raphson is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better
approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The most
basic version starts with a single-variable function :math:`f(x)` defined for a
real variable :math:`x`, the function's derivative :math:`f'(x)`, and an initial
guess :math:`x_0` for a root of :math:`f(x)`. 

If the function :math:`f(x)` is defined and differentiable in an open interval
containing a root, then the Newtonâ€“Raphson method will converge to a root of the
function. The method generates a sequence of approximations :math:`x_n` that
converges to a root of :math:`f(x)` if the initial guess is close enough, and
the function :math:`f(x)` is suitably smooth.

**Step 1**: Evaluate :math:`f'(x)`

**Step 2**: Choose an initial guess :math:`x_0`

**Step 3**: Find the next guess :math:`x_i` using the formula:

.. math::
    
   x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}

**Step 4**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired accuracy is achieved.

**Example**: Find the root of the equation :math:`f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - 3` using
the Newton-Raphson method, with initial guess :math:`x_0 = 1`.

First, evaluate the derivative of the function:

.. math::
    
   f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2x

Then, find the next guess using the formula:

.. math::

    x_1 = 1 - \frac{f(1)}{f'(1)} = 1 - \frac{-3}{1} = 4

Follow the same steps, we have the table below:

     - 1.8664
     - 0.0182
     - 6.7177
     - 1.8637

After 6 iterations, we have the approximate root of the equation is
:math:`x = 1.8637`.

Estimating the error
--------------------

Usually, when performing this calculation, we will use one more operation
called **error**. There are two types of errors that we can use to
estimate the error of the approximation. (See :ref:`errors`.)

**Example**: Using the problem above, calculate the approximate error and the
relative approximate error of the last iterations.

We can see the 6th iteration of the table above is :math:`x = 1.8637`, the
previous approximation is :math:`x = 1.8664`. Therefore, the approximate error
is:

.. math::
    
   E_a = 1.8664 - 1.8637 = 0.0027

The relative approximate error is:

.. math::
    
   \epsilon_a = \frac{0.0027}{1.8637} = 0.0014

So, the approximate error is :math:`0.0027` and the relative approximate error
is :math:`0.0014`.
